B00I1QCPCG,JasonB,Does exactly what it's designed to do.,"First thing to know: if you don't understand the purpose of this type of device, DO NOT ORDER.

Second thing to know: the ""pain"" is the point.

It's supposed to be sharp feeling - you're tricking your body into thinking the skin/tissue was damaged and then blood is sent to the area to assist healing. Since there is no actual wound, you get the benefits of extra blood flow which assist with a bunch of things including muscle pain relief.

In no way should this, under proper use, damage your skin or cause an open wound. If you've ""cut"" your hand opening the package or handling the pad, you're clearly doing something crazy.

I stand barefoot, full weight (205 Lbs) on this pad twice a day for +2 minutes each session. Never have I ever had a cut created from standing on this pad as some reviews have implied.

It works spectacularly well for what it's designed for. This is such an important part of my daily routine that I pack the mat and take it with me on vacation.","February 14, 2025",Color: Large - Black/WhiteVerified Purchase

B00I1QCPCG,Cara,Great for Muscle Relaxation and Pain Relief,"I’ve been dealing with back problems for a while now, and someone recommended I try an acupressure mat. I lay on it while watching TV—it’s a great way to relax and unwind.

There is a noticeable difference when lying on it on carpet versus hardwood floors. The carpet makes it feel a little softer, while the hardwood gives you a more intense experience. If you take your shirt off, you’ll definitely feel it more, but that can actually be a good thing if you’re looking for a deeper sensation.

Standing on the mat also provides a surprising amount of relief for my feet, even more than it does for my back. It’s a nice way to stimulate circulation and get the blood flowing.

I think this mat is great for relieving tension and promoting relaxation. It’s especially helpful for keeping your blood moving after long periods of sitting or standing. I’ve been using it daily, and I’m already feeling the benefits. Highly recommend it for anyone dealing with muscle soreness or just looking for a simple way to relieve stress!

The next morning I sat in a chair with my feet on the arched piece for 10 minutes and then stood on the mat for 10 minutes. I really feel like it benefited me. That evening I did a repeat of the night before and again I slept better than I have been. My wife .still hasn't used it but I'm loving it.

B00I1QCPCG,K,I'm hooked!!,"I stayed at my brother's house and he has one of these without the neck pillow, from the expensive brand. The first time I tried his, I thought he was nuts bc it hurt when I stood on it (barefoot). Then, afterwards, I felt a calm over my entire body that I've never felt before. So I put thin socks on and stood on it again. I slept SOOO deeply and peacefully that night. The entire week I stayed at his house, I kept standing on it with thin socks and felt this incredible calm wash over me completely. As soon as I got home, I ordered this one which included the neck pillow (and is much less expensive than his). I never thought to lay on it bc I only stood on my brother's. I just layed on this thing with a thin shirt. I cannot even tell you how good it feels (pleasure and pain are right next to each other. Lol). It feels SOOO good to me when I'm laying and standing on it! Then, the peace and calm that I feel after I'm off it is mind blowing to me. I'm hooked on this thing.

At first, the sensation is a bit intense, but you quickly get used to it. After a few minutes, I felt a deep sense of relaxation. It's like a mini-massage for your back and neck.

I’ve spent definitely spent more on less when it comes to torture devices cleverly marketed as pain relief…I can definitely say that it distracted me enough from my old pain just to give me different and new pain. I can also say that my particular model of meat suit has not been properly (if at all) maintained, so maybe this will be more effective for you.

This accupressure mat is a gem !

Yes,
It takes a moment to adjust to the physical sensation;
Once that is accepted,
It actually is interesting & feels good.
The mattress & pillow covers remove simply for washing.
The unit folds nicely to store in a small space.
It is lightweight;
Easily portable.
The colour of the covering is solid black.

The mat is a little uncomfortable when you first lay on it, but you get used to it. To me, it hurts more when you get off of it. My back always stings for about 5 minutes or so afterwards.

The foam on the inside the cover of the other brand is more dense, the spikes are more comfortable, and they pay living wages to the folks who make them.

B00I1QCPCG,Casey Radcliff,Absolutely amazing! Do yourself a favor and buy this now!,"After getting flooded with social media ads for a competing brand’s acupressure mat I decided to do a little research. Here’s what I learned…

The ProsourceFit acupressure mat and pillow set accomplishes the EXACT same thing as the competing ones at about 1/5 of the price. It is not made in a quaint village from environmentally friendly materials. It feels almost EXACTLY the same as the competition’s mat (yes, I bought the other one too and returned it after 1 use for comparison purposes) and comes with a pillow!

Now for what it does… I was incredibly skeptical, but intrigued by the claims made about these acupressure mats. And come to find out, they actually work! I have had chronic neck and back pain for as long as I can remember. I exercise and stretch regularly (5-7 days/week) and would consider myself in pretty good shape. I have a fairly high stress life/job and regularly have trouble sleeping.

I have had knots in my upper neck on either side of my spine that inhibit my range of motion for years. Massage helped, but never fully diminished the knots nor alleviated the pain. In four 15 minutes uses over the course of 2 days the knots in my neck were COMPLETELY gone and I had full range of motion. For real.

Furthermore, my general mood has been elevated, overall body soreness is lessened and I’m having less trouble falling asleep at night.

My current regiment is 5 minutes standing, 15 minutes laying down first thing in the morning and last thing before bed at night. I am 1 week into using the acupressure mat and will try to update this review over time.

If you are on the fence about buying this I hope this review convinces you to give it a try. I was not paid to write this, and I’m not sure if everyone will have as positive results as I have.

Finally, I does hurt… at first. Every time. Once you push through that pain, it can be very relaxing. I can’t take more than 5 minutes standing though… but I’ll get there!

B07YN2DL1R,Chaybee1,"Mostly great, confusing borders, variance in shades","Pros: Exactly as described as far as 3/4"" thickness
Is soft enough for floor exercises
Inexpensive and easy option for a ""relatively"" clean look
Contrary to other reviews I read, these do not slip around on my ""fake wood"" laminate flooring

Cons: As others have mentioned, there are light and dark variances in tiles. This is pretty annoying.
Maybe it's just me, but the borders confused the hell out of me. Make sure you plan out your space because I
ran into issues where I had tiles connected that needed to be turned to have a border line up, otherwise, there
is a ""triangle"" shape. What I mean is, it appears there are length and corner borders and I didn't realize there
was a difference.
Pay close attention to the ACTUAL measurements. I initially ordered the 96sq ft (24 tiles) option for a 94 sq ft
room. Somehow, (again, maybe it's me) I ended up short a tile so had to order a 6 pk separately. In doing so,
the tiles that came were darker than the one square area that I needed it placed. I guess on a positive note, I at
least now have 5 extra tiles in case one of them gets damaged.

All in all, for the price, thickness and just the right amount of cushion, I still believe these are a good value and
should hold up nicely for a while.","February 10, 2025",Color: Grey - 3/4 Inch - 24 Sq Ft - 6 TilesVerified Purchase

The bad : The finish is wildly inconsistent. Some tiles are a nice dark, black while others are a charcoal gray. The floor never rebounds after being compressed, see the photos that show the one time I wore cleats on them - they didn't tear, but are permanently dented weeks later. POROUS. As I mentioned, the matte finish on these is not good. Sweat permanently stained mine after just one use. I've tried a few cleaners on it.

2 stars was probably generous. I'd rather not leave a bad review for a company but I can't imagine why these are rated so highly and Amazon recommends them.","January 6, 2025",Color: Black - 1 Inch - 72 Sq Ft - 18 TilesVerified Purchase

Both colors of mats needed a couple of days to ""vent"" because they smelled like chemicals when they first arrived. The quality control is pretty good - a couple mats had small manufacturing defects like holes and marks, but otherwise, these mats fit together well with mats of other colors (from this brand).

I accidentally left a weight on these mats for a few hours, but the impression left behind recovered the next day. Overall, I really like these mats once they had some time to break in. They're pretty comfortable to lay on as well.

The material feels durable, yet comfortable under food, and cleaning is a breeze. The only little inconvenience is that when putting the pieces together, because how the shapes are cut, some corner pieces overlap. Easily fixable with a knife just cut the little odd piece off to fit.

It happened over the course of a couple months. You can see from the attached photo what I mean -- this tile can no longer be interlocked to the rest correctly. If I force this section to zip with the rest of the tiles, then the center tiles bubble up and lift off the floor slightly, and then with any use it just presses down and unzips itself again.

B07YN125FS,Amazon Customer,Made of foam...,"I knew that these were made of foam before I bought them. They feel nice to walk on, but there are a couple of concerns I have. First, I have a Hoist bench with rollers/wheels, and it won't roll! Why? The foam. The bench is heavy and sinks the foam down, making difficult/impossible to roll. I will say this: you can slide it, but you run the risk of catching a corner and tearing the foam.

Next, because they are foam, if you leave heavy weight on them for an extended period of time, they will sink in. It will take a long time for the indention to leave, if it ever does.

Be careful, because if you have a cat, it might like it more than you! I have to keep my door closed because I caught my cat poking at it with her nails.

Although I may not really care for the product, it does what it says it will do. When I have to replace these, I'm going to buy the rubber ones. They may be more expensive, but I'm not too sure how long these foam ones will last. Good luck with yours!","February 3, 2025",Color: Black - 1/2 Inch - 48 Sq Ft - 12 TilesVerified Purchase

However, we were having issues with the tiles getting air trapped under them during normal use. We ended up installing three smaller areas for each section of our gym; this is working very well. Couple of things to be aware of when you first install this product: (1) there is a rubber smell that will dissipate within 24 hours and (2) there is an oily (?) film on the top that will go away with normal use over time.

B07YN125FS,AC303,Not all they are cracked up to be,"So I really wanna like these more than I do, but here's the honest rundown:

GOOD
1) These snap together pretty easily and offer nice customization options because no room is going to completely align with the 2 x 2' footprint of each tile times how many one needs.
2) The padding is nice and welcome.

BAD
1) These things off-gas terribly, and having bought them in the winter where it's barely above 20 many days I can't just open up a window, and using my indoor air filter doesn't take away the smell.
2) There is some chemical that comes off of these that gets on my shoes and so then when I walk around the rest of my house, my shoes are slippery for a bit, even though I have vacuumed these and literally mopped them with a Bona mop. Makes me worry what sort of chemical is getting all over my house, and I really don't want my dog to be on them and get that stuff on her paws.
3) The tiles aren't really all that stable on top of a luxury vinyl plank floor and sometimes slip and come apart a little bit (see pic), and I don't have them set up wall to wall, but one shouldn't have to in order to be stable.
4) The color of these things is not necessarily all that consistent, which isn't the end of the world, but there's something not quite up to snuff with the production process.
5) There are odd little corners that don't really go together with any other set of the tiles, depending on how many you use continuously so it leaves some uneven ends (see pic).

Overall, it's nice to have a padded floor for my workout room, and I'm not sure that any other tiles out there are going to be any less smelly or more stable, but I can't say I'm nearly 100% pleased with them. If it wasn't such a hassle to take them all out and send them back I probably would, but I'm hoping at least over time the off-gassing smell/toxicity goes away.","January 26, 2025",Color: Blue - 1/2 Inch - 48 Sq Ft - 12 TilesVerified Purchase

B07YN125FS,D. Taylor,Color isn't consistent and it needs a non-skid rug gripper if used on a tile floor,"This was quick to piece together. I played around with the layout and didn't need to cut anything to align the corners. You can push the completed mat around on a smooth surface to reposition it but you can't lift it up without it coming apart. I ordered twelve tiles (6' x 8' finished). The gray color was inconsistent among the tiles and one of the tiles came scraped--see photo. Its textured surface is pretty sturdy and stable which helps my knees. However, in doing a step forward the entire mat would scoot a couple of inches across my tile floor. I bought a non-skid rug pad gripper (+$20) to go under it which seems to have resolved the issue.","January 21, 2025",Color: Grey - 1/2 Inch - 48 Sq Ft - 12 TilesVerified Purchase

B07YN125FS,SayedIslam,Good for decor. That’s it though,"Got these mats for my home gym. They give my home gym an aesthetic look, but in practicality, I wouldn’t get this.

First, they are way too soft. It should be firm but not hard.

Second, you put anything heavy on there, the puzzle pieces start unpuzzling. You’ll find yourself pushing it back in a lot.

Third, NO GRIP. What you want in a gym mat is good grip. This mat is too slick.

You’re better off spending the extra money on horsestall mats from tractor supply. Which is what I will do.

The box is full of mats different sizes that don’t even connect to each other. Their size ranges to almost an entire 1 inch shorter than the same product. These mats can’t connect to themselves. My choice now is either have an uneven, partly unconnected floor or return the product and hope it was a flaw? Sizing is sizing and it should never be different for a product like this.

B07GY1PH4K,Yoo Family,Cute and does the job,"Not a fan of a checkerboard living room and I did a large enough space to need 3.5 sets, so I went with a herringbone. I like the final product and it looks nice in my living room, my baby seems to like crawling on it.

For those who are REALLY picky: I wanted a longer herringbone but the tiles are actually all different shades of the same color. I suggest keeping them in pairs, that way they match. I tried making my pattern 3 tiles long but had a hard time finding a third tile that matched the color and pattern for each pair, I gave up after it took me 15 minutes to find 3 matches. The textured print is sometimes deep and sometimes shallow, and the colors slightly off so it is noticeable when you combine different grays or different beiges. In pairs (they come in matching pairs) and in herringbone such that the same colors never touch each other is perfect, you can’t tell they are all different. The beige tiles are also a tiny bit thicker than the others so they sometimes stick up a bit but it will only bother you if you are really picky like I am.

It does the job for now, we have a 6 month old who is learning to crawl, hopefully these hold up for a couple years. I am very pleased with the finished product, and will update the post if problems arise in the future.","December 29, 2024",Color: White/Grey/Beige - 36 TilesVerified Purchase

B002YQUP7Q,Pleasetryadifferentname,How to find printable assembly instructions for doorway pull-up online,"The bar seems sturdy; the little screws not so much. I got the bar up using a manual screwdriver, though directions say “REQUIRED TOOL: Electric Drill (Not Included).” That “not included” was not a surprise. The absence of any included assembly directions WAS a surprise. I eventually found the directions online—an illustrated printable pdf that included one page of simple and fairly clear directions, plus several pages that describe exercises you can do with the bar. To find this pdf, search “doorway_pullup_bar pdf” which will take you to a page that says “Download PROSOURCEFIT DOORWAY PULL-UP BAR Instruction Manual and Exercise Manual.” You'll see how to do this; it's easy and it's free. Btw, before I found the pdf source I found a Prosource site that lacked assembly directions but warned of deadly toxins included with the bar. Toxins in products, especially products made in China, are pretty common these days. Still, I got the bar to improve my physical well-being, so it's dismaying that its use entails an added set of health risks.","January 14, 2025",Style: DoorwayVerified Purchase

B002YQUP7Q,Manning Yip,It slipped out of the door frame. No Instructions.,"Essentially, the issue lies in the bar twisting whenever anyone would try to use it. This twisting is an issue due to the fact that it loosens the bar. This may be an oversight for the design, but it proved to be serious issue when my younger sibling attempted to use the bar and it slipped right out of the frame.

Reviews mention that this bar did not come with instructions, that is true. Some other reviews mentioned a 1 star rating due to the fact that they were unable to properly twist out both sides of the bar, this was not an issue as it turned out that the side that would not twist outwards needed to be twisted anticlockwise instead of the typical righty-tighty motion. Reviewers also note the 'cancer causing foam', which I can follow up to be true as it is labeled on the box that the pull up bar came in.

The package also came with some set screws and outer metal coverings for the rubber ends of the pull up bar. No instructions, poor design choice, and including cancer causing materials in the product make this one star review what it is.","December 28, 2024",Style: DoorwayVerified Purchase

I have zero confidence that 1/2"" long screws will hold up, so I used 1-5/8"" screws I had on hand to get through the door case into the studs that frame the opening. Also, the foam grips are too narrow. They need to be spaced wider or be wider. I'm not doing pull ups with my hands by my collar bones. Shoulder width for me is the width of center section.

Highly recommend!","January 23, 2025",Color: BlackVerified Purchase

B01ENUM0W8,Hot Foot,Way better than the floor,"Initially reluctant to try only a 24 inch wide mat. Was directed to 9 weeks of physical therapy training that also included home exercise program. I'm 6' 1' 250# and mat does work well. Use it twice a day and seems to be holding up really well. The 24"" mat is accommodating but if your much larger than me I wound opt for at least a 28"" wide mat.","January 8, 2025",Color: BlackVerified Purchase

B01ENUM0W8,Doc Gom,It’s making working out so much easier on my body,"I haven’t used this for long so we’ll see how it holds up, but so far so good. The one I have is about the size of a yoga mat, slightly shorter length. It’s thick and I was surprised at how dense it was when I first stepped on it. I’ve used others that are more squishy than anything. Not only is it extremely supportive but also comfortable. It’s folds up easily, easy to hide away and easy to clean. Has a nice durable feel to it. It does slide a bit, even on top of my yoga mat, it bunches a bit at the folds if you are doing exercises requiring stretching a leg out, like side lunges or lunges. The straps also get in the way a little bit of some exercises like alternating to and from push ups to other forms. The upsides heavily outweigh the setbacks and I’m glad to enjoy the benefits of this mat!","December 3, 2024",Color: GreyVerified Purchase

B01ENUM0W8,Ozark Lady,So far I like it,"Only had for 2 days so can't say how it'll hold up. Like the tri-fold with handles, easy to transport. It's light to carry, but nice sturdy feel when using. It's very thick, and not soft, but has enough give that it's surprisingly comfortable. Plenty long enough for my husband to use. I like it.","November 19, 2024",Color: BlueVerified Purchase
B01ENUM0W8,Don,Great Pad,"I bought this for working around the house. I lay it down when working on things inside and it provides great padding. I just worked on my cabinets I laid it out.

Not as many aches and pains in this senior citizen now. :)","November 16, 2024",Color: BlueVerified Purchase

B01ENUM0W8,Miss Tig,My only regret is waiting so long to order,"I first heard of this product from the Knees over Toes Guy / ATG program. I waited for over a year to purchase this as I was waiting to see if it went on sale. It never did, but, I finally decided to purchase it because my thick yoga pad was just not cutting it on my hard floor any more. I absolutely love this pad! I mostly use it for doing floor exercises. No more knee pain when doing bird dogs! I really, really hate doing Nordic curls, which was the original intention with buying this, but, I know this pad will make them bearable. Definitely get this tri-fold pad over the smaller pad, even if you also just want to do Nordic curls or use it for balance training, because having the larger option is really, really great, and, it's great that this folds up. I don't see myself using my old yoga mat ever again!","November 15, 2024",Color: BlackVerified Purchase
